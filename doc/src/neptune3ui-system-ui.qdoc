   \title Neptune 3 UI - System UI

   Neptune 3's System UI is a Qt QML application comprised of one or two top-level
   QWindows: a \l{center stack display}{Center Console} window and an optional
   \l{Instrument Cluster} window. But it is a special Qt QML application as it
   uses a Wayland server Qt platform backend, which turns it into a fully fledged
   compositing window manager.

   Regular applications (which are called as Neptune 3 applications or simply
   applications) then show up on System UI as plain QML Items that it positions
   on its QML scene as it sees fit. Applications use a \l{Qt Wayland}{Wayland client Qt
   platform backend} instead.

   On target hardware each of the System UI windows will drive an entire display
   or screen (ie, be fullscreen, controlling all that is rendered on them). But
   on a development environment you will see each System UI window as a plain desktop
   window.

   Neptune 3 defines three types of application windows, each of them being handled
   differently by System UI. Namely application center console windows, application
   instrument cluster windows and pop-up windows. A Neptune 3 application must have
   one application center console window and, optionally, one application instrument
   cluster window.

   System UI is able to tell them apart by checking their "windowType" window
   property. Application code doesn't have to worry about this implementation
   detail though, this is taken care of by the specialized QML components
   \l{ApplicationCCWindow}, \l{ApplicationICWindow} and \l{PopupWindow}.

   System UI also provides a way to take a screenshot of the current state of
   Neptune 3 UI and export it. At the same time, it also exports the output of
   Qt diagnostic tool. The exported files will be stored under \e {/tmp} folder.
   In order to do this, the user can press and hold the clock at the top right
   corner of the \l{center stack display}{Center Console} or press CTRL + p.

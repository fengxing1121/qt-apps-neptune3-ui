Cluster app contains of gauges and telltales. By default, it shows the 2D gauges. It also supports 3D gauges that runs on Qt 3D Studio Runtime.
IMPORTANT: there should present Qt 3D Studio Runtime in system and "qt3DStudioRuntimeExist" property in am-config-*.yaml should be set.

If the target platform is not so powerful it is preferable to use 2D.

When property in am-config-*.yaml is set, Neptune control app allows switching between flat and 3d gauges on fly.

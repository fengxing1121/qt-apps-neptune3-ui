        # high -- high quality model (there are many polygons in each model part)
        # middle -- ~60% of polygons in each model part (compared to the previous)
        # others two load model from stl format (fast start with lower memory usage then previous, but with lower quality)
        # low -- the amount of polygons the same as in high but the textures have some artifacts
